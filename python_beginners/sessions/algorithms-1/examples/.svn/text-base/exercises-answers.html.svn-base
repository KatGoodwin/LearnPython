<h1>Answers to Algorithms Exercises</h1>

<h3>Exercise 1</h3>
There are lots of possible answers for this one.  An example is:
<!-- XXX add example answer to algorithms ex1 -->


<h3>Exercise 2</h3>
Algorithm to draw 'swirls' pattern:
<pre>
    set(2,2)
    move(14)
    turn(left)
    move(14)
    turn(left)
    move(12)
    turn(left)
    move(12)
    turn(left)
    move(10)
    turn(left)
    move(10)
    turn(left)
    move(8)
    turn(left)
    move(8)
    turn(left)
    move(6)
    turn(left)
    move(6)
    turn(left)
    move(4)
    turn(left)
    move(4)
    turn(left)
    move(2)
    turn(left)
    move(2)
</pre>

<h3>Exercise 3</h3>
Algorithm to draw 'swirls' pattern using a loop
<pre>
length = 14
start = 2

set(start, start)

while length &gt;= 2:
    move(length)
    turn(left)
    move(length)
    turn(left)
    
    length = length - 2
    
</pre>


<h3>Exercise 3 - Extension</h3>
Algorithm to draw 'swirls' pattern using a loop, with a varying gap between swirls
<pre>
length = 14
start = 2
step = 3

set(start, start)

while length &gt;= step:
    move(length)
    turn(left)
    move(length)
    turn(left)
    
    length = length - step
    
</pre>
