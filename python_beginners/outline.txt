This is intended to be an outline of my current thinking on the python for beginners training course.  

My aims with this course:
* to teach with outcomes in mind, not just to tick off a list of theoretical concepts
* to never teach anything "wrong" just to enable a more interesting task to be set
* to always use the correct terminology from the start, so trainees can get used to it
* to encourage a problem solving approach to programming, using the concepts as tools, rather than the aim of the teaching
* to encourage good coding practice as soon as possible, but not so early or so vehemently that it distracts from the vital concepts

Each starred item doesn't necessarily represent a file of slides, and each section is not necessarily contained within a single directory.  This is so that the individual elements can be moved around to change the structure of the course if required, but they're still organised in such a way that everything can be fou nd.

1:  Boring background admin stuff.  
    * Who are we
    * platform
        * including, if required, introduction to running things from the shell
        * intro to any applications
    * python intro without talking about anything technical
    

2:  The very basics:
    * what is a data type
    * what are identifiers, variables and literals
    * what are statements and expressions
    * what is a function
    * simple strings

3:  Running a bit of python
    * simple numbers
    * introduction to the interpreter (numbers exercise)
    * simple strings
    * introduction to whitespace, editors, scripts and running them. (string exercises)

4:  A problem-based approach to programming - Algorithsm
    * introduce simple linear algorithms that are written on paper, and interpreted by trainees 
    * introduce instruction sets by giving a simple syntax for directing something
    * introduce idea of algorithms with repeating elements
    * add elements to instruction set to allow for this
(IDEA:  get them to write the python to generate the instructions rather than trying to display the output with something complicated?)


5:  Interacting with the program
